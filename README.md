LocalizationKit is a library designed to make managing localizations in .NET easier.

## Differences between LocalizationKit and SettingsKit

The main differences between LocalizationKit and SettingsKit, besides SettingsKit being meant for generic Settings management, is that Localizationkit is designed to load existing localization files and provide programmatic access to the localizations. 

In the future I _may_ create a tool to generate localization files for use with LocalizationKit and/or SettingsKit.
